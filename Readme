Smart robotic arm for sorting objects
A smart robotic arm for sorting objects!
Imagine a robot arm equipped an AI camera that can detect objects. This arm objective is to pick objects, identify them, sort them, and show information about them. To make it simple: Assume we have:
Shapes: Spheres & Boxes.
Colors: Red, Yellow, & Green.
Output: 
	1- Total number of each of Boxes, Spheres, Red, Yellow, & Green objects. 
	2- Volume of the shapes.
	3- Recommended box size to fit all objects.
